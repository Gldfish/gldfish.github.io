\f0\fs24 \cf0 ok now let me try and type on this MacBook keyboard. This is also very smooth but the keys are a bit further apart which will induce more typing fatigue overtime. But the key travel is very low so that also compensates. Overall I think typing on the HHKB pro 2 is just more satisfying than typing on a boring MacBook Pro keyboard. The hhkb just has this super satisfying click clack and thock sound to it, and it\'92s just amazing.\

Alright so this is a quick test of the HHKB keyboard on my MacBook. It couldn\'92t identify the keyboard but in the end I was able to just select Euro ISO layout and everything worked fine. Now it\'92s time to finish me 3rd blogpost.}
