Hi everyone,

So what is this website? And what can you expect to find here?
Well that is a great question!

This is my personal website on which I will be sharing everything that I'm passionate about. 
It's pretty hard for me to define exactly everything that will be on this website, since the thing is that I
want to let the content of this website grow as 'natural' and 'organic' as possible. By that I mean that whatever
pops in my mind, whatever I felt like making, I will post it to this website.

My head is always filled with cool little ideas, but I have never had a central place on which I could share what
I was working on. I tried Twitter, Instagram, and in fact I already tried making personal websites before. But somehow
it never worked out and felt more like a chore instead of a fun and easy thing to expand.

So I decided to start out as simple, cheap and easy as possible to setup this website. The fact that I'm writing this blog
in a .txt file instead of using some over the top CMS like Wordpress, Squarespace or Webflow (which I used to use professionally),
is a testament to how simple I'm keeping things for now. As of writing this first blog the entirety of this website is made up
of no more than 14 lines of html (lol)!

In the last 2 to 3 years I've become more and more interested in (obessed with) old school website and games from the early 2000's
to about 2012'ish..... (to be continued on a later time and date, since it's currently 00:16 30-04-2021, time to go to bed)
